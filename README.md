DTI and DKI Tutorial with DIPY
Welcome to this tutorial on Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) using DIPY (Diffusion Imaging in Python). This guide is designed to help you understand and apply DTI and DKI methodologies to your diffusion MRI data using DIPY, a comprehensive library dedicated to the analysis of diffusion imaging data. By following this tutorial, you'll be able to explore your data, experiment with various parameters, and gain insights into the underlying microstructural properties of the tissue.

Getting Started
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have DIPY installed in your Python environment. If you haven't installed DIPY yet, you can do so by running:


`pip install dipy`

Additionally, this tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of Python and familiarity with neuroimaging data. If you're new to diffusion MRI or DIPY, consider reviewing the DIPY documentation and introductory materials on diffusion imaging principles.

Tutorial Overview
This tutorial is divided into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of DTI and DKI analysis:

1. Introduction to Diffusion Imaging
Basic principles of diffusion imaging
Overview of DTI and DKI
2. Preprocessing Steps
Data loading and visualization
Preprocessing techniques, including denoising and correction for motion and eddy-current distortions
3. DTI Analysis
Fitting the diffusion tensor model
Calculating DTI metrics (e.g., Fractional Anisotropy, Mean Diffusivity)
Visualizing DTI results
4. DKI Analysis
Fitting the diffusion kurtosis model
Exploring DKI metrics (e.g., Mean Kurtosis, Kurtosis Fractional Anisotropy)
Visualizing DKI results
